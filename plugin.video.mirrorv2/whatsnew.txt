---------------------------

Version 2.0.11b

Issue resolved
--------------
The problems with the scrapers are now solved and thanks to Addons4Kodi with the powerful open scrapers, my MirrorV2 is now fully equipped with these scrapers.
Thank you for the team work.

Tip: Maybe just empty the usermap or re-install MirrorV2.
MirrorV2 is now based on OpenScraper.
